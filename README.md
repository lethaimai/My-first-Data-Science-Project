# My first Data Science Project

From April 2005 to September 2005, the [UCI Default of Credit Card Clients Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/default+of+credit+card+clients) 
contains information about default payments, demographic factors, credit data, and 
payment history of Taiwanese credit card clients.

The repository containes three folders:

* ***dataset*** folder with the Default of Credit Card Clients dataset
* ***imgs*** folder, that containes all the images for the report
*  ***results*** folder, in which all the results are stored


The analysis is divided into different steps:


* Data exploration: description of the attributes and understanding of each features;
* Data cleaning: processing of data that involves correction of errors, outlier detection, analysis of correlation;
* Outlier detection: identification and removal of rows considered as possible outliers by different algorithm of outlier detection;
* Correlation and dimensionality reduction: analysis of correlated features and application of PCA;
* Class imbalancing managment: application of some tecninques for managing imbalancing in classes;
* Classification algorithms and metrics for evaluation;
* Comments on results achieved.
